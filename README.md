# IntroBeam

Demo application to showcase features and functionalities of the Erlang VM (BEAM).

It is inspired by the talk "The Soul of Erlang and Elixir" from Saša Jurić but keeps the
additions to the auto-generated Phoenix skeleton app to the minimum.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
